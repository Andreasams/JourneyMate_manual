## Phase 2 output summary (2026-02-20)

| Output | Status |
|--------|--------|
| `_reference/BUNDLE_STANDARD.md` | ✅ Created — 10-section standard, minimum bars, examples |
| All 14 BUNDLE.md files — Riverpod State section | ✅ Patched — provider reads/writes tables added |
| `02_business_profile/BUNDLE.md` — pubspec fix | ✅ Fixed — `provider:` → `flutter_riverpod:` |
| `07_settings/missing_place/BUNDLE_missing_place.md` | ✅ Deepened — MissingLocationFormWidget internals |
| `07_settings/contact_us/BUNDLE_contact_us.md` | ✅ Deepened — ContactUsFormWidget internals |
| `07_settings/share_feedback/BUNDLE_share_feedback.md` | ✅ Deepened — FeedbackFormWidget internals |
| `_reference/BUNDLE_AUDIT_REPORT.md` | ✅ Created — all 5 known issues now resolved |
| `_reference/BUILDSHIP_API_REFERENCE.md` | ✅ Updated — endpoints #10, #11, #12 added (`/missingplace`, `/contact`, `/feedbackform`) |
| `pages/05_business_information/` | ✅ Renamed from `05_contact_details/` (git mv) |
| `pages/06_welcome_onboarding/BUNDLE_welcome_page.md` | ✅ pageName corrected to `'welcomePage'` |
| `pages/06_welcome_onboarding/GAP_ANALYSIS_welcome_page.md` | ✅ pageName corrected to `'welcomePage'` |
| `CLAUDE.md` | ✅ 5 new product decisions added; paths updated |

**5 known issues — ALL RESOLVED (2026-02-20):**
1. ✅ `05_contact_details/` renamed to `05_business_information/` via `git mv`
2. ✅ ContactUs Subject: free-text confirmed (match FlutterFlow, not JSX dropdown)
3. ✅ FeedbackForm topic: localized string is fine — `supabaseInsertObject` does no string-matching; goes straight to `text` column
4. ✅ Welcome page pageName: corrected to `'welcomePage'`; BuildShip + Supabase update required separately
5. ✅ 3 form endpoints: added as #10, #11, #12 in BUILDSHIP_API_REFERENCE.md (all use `supabaseInsertObject` node)

---

## Confirmed product decisions (see CLAUDE.md for full details)

1. **CityID = 17 (Copenhagen) always** — no city switching, use `const kDefaultCityId = 17`
2. **No favorites feature** — `restaurantIsFavorited` is future, skip entirely
3. **Filters are a bottom sheet in v2** — not inline 3-column overlay. Local tab state.
4. **foodDrinkTypes IS used** — populated by GET_FILTERS_FOR_SEARCH, stored in filterProvider
5. **No direct Supabase** — all API through BuildShip
6. **GitHub repo:** `Andreasams/JourneyMate_manual`
7. **ContactUs Subject is free-text** — match FlutterFlow (no dropdown)
8. **FeedbackForm topic is localized label string** — goes straight to Supabase `text` column via `supabaseInsertObject`; no mapping needed
9. **Welcome page analytics pageName = `'welcomePage'`** — corrected from inconsistent `'homepage'`; BuildShip + Supabase update required
10. **3 form endpoints use `supabaseInsertObject`** — simple direct Supabase REST POST; no server logic; documented as #10–12 in BUILDSHIP_API_REFERENCE.md
11. **`pages/05_business_information/`** — renamed from `05_contact_details/`

## Phase 2: COMPLETE ✅

Phase 2 tasks are finished. See `_reference/BUNDLE_AUDIT_REPORT.md` for per-file findings.

**What the next session must do first:** Phase 3 — write `_reference/BUILDSHIP_REQUIREMENTS.md` (BuildShip gap analysis). Read IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.txt for Phase 3 task definition before starting.

---

## Phase 2 original task list (for reference only)

**Task 2A:** Create `_reference/BUNDLE_STANDARD.md` (the standard template all BUNDLE.md files must follow) ✅

**Task 2B:** Audit each of these 14 files against the standard, cross-reference with MASTER_STATE_MAP.md and BUILDSHIP_API_REFERENCE.md: ✅

| # | Page | BUNDLE.md path | GAP_ANALYSIS path |
|---|------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Search | `pages/01_search/BUNDLE.md` | `pages/01_search/GAP_ANALYSIS.md` |
| 2 | Business Profile | `pages/02_business_profile/BUNDLE.md` | `pages/02_business_profile/GAP_ANALYSIS.md` |
| 3 | Menu Full Page | `pages/03_menu_full_page/BUNDLE.md` | `pages/03_menu_full_page/GAP_ANALYSIS.md` |
| 4 | Gallery Full Page | `pages/04_gallery_full_page/BUNDLE.md` | `pages/04_gallery_full_page/GAP_ANALYSIS.md` |
| 5 | Contact Details | `pages/05_contact_details/BUNDLE_information_page.md` | `pages/05_contact_details/GAP_ANALYSIS_information_page.md` |
| 6 | Welcome Page | `pages/06_welcome_onboarding/BUNDLE_welcome_page.md` | `pages/06_welcome_onboarding/GAP_ANALYSIS_welcome_page.md` |
| 6b | App Settings Flow | `pages/06_welcome_onboarding/BUNDLE_app_settings_initiate_flow.md` | `pages/06_welcome_onboarding/GAP_ANALYSIS_app_settings_initiate_flow.md` |
| 7 | Settings Main | `pages/07_settings/BUNDLE.md` | `pages/07_settings/GAP_ANALYSIS.md` |
| 7a | Contact Us | check `pages/07_settings/contact_us/` | — |
| 7b | Localization | check `pages/07_settings/localization/` | — |
| 7c | Location Sharing | check `pages/07_settings/location_sharing/` | — |
| 7d | Missing Place | check `pages/07_settings/missing_place/` | — |
| 7e | Share Feedback | check `pages/07_settings/share_feedback/` | — |

**Output:** `_reference/BUNDLE_AUDIT_REPORT.md` — gaps per page, "Claude builds" vs "needs BuildShip", missing sections.

**After audit:** USER REVIEW REQUIRED before proceeding to Phase 3.

## Open questions for user

None. Phase 3 can start immediately.
